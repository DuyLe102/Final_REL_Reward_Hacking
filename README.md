# Final_REL_Reward_Hacking
This resporitory is inspired form the paper "[Correlated Proxies: A New Definition and Improved Mitigation for Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03185)".

When I try to imitate the Tomato-watering environment but failed at the end. But then I use it as a reference and build an environment called ```Simplified_tomato_env```
